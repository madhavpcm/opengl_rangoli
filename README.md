# opengl_rangoli

This project is part of the Code a Rangoli competition by ISTE-NITC. 

```opengl_rangoli``` is a full fledged rangoli editor which fundamentally creates shapes using bezier curves. This application supports layer-like editing
as seen in major photoediting software like Photoshop, Gimp etc. 

Here are a few milestones I would like this to cover/ have been covered:

- [x] Layers
- [x] Mirror x and y axis
- [x] ImGui integration
- [ ] ImGui advanced options like
   - [ ] Save output as png buttons
   - [ ] Infinite Undo/Redo button/ keymap
   - [ ] Docking
- [ ] Advanced options for bezier curve operations while adding or removing points 
(like to sort or not sort on x and y coords using shift,ctrl etc..)
- [ ] Code Refactoring
